2016-01-13 21:45:27,Donnie,"I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you?"
2016-01-14 15:44:06,Frank,You were never invited to my house.
2016-01-14 17:47:33,Frank,Deputy sheriffs.
2016-01-14 19:27:54,Donnie,"Wait a minute, why can't I give my opinion? It's a free country!"
2016-01-15 07:01:32,Donnie,We still think the temporal lobe...
2016-01-17 12:23:40,Donnie,"Promise me you won't forget tomorrow. You'll remember, won't you? You won't say that it was just a d"
2016-01-18 16:10:13,Frank,Then you and Maelcom get out of here before the place is crawling with guardsmen.
2016-01-18 18:13:55,Donnie,Have you worked here long?
2016-01-19 18:33:00,Donnie,It's a crude symbolic language -- looks primitive.
2016-01-20 15:31:46,Frank,What are you blubbering about?
2016-01-21 18:26:20,Donnie,Flown... And that's the last you'll see of them?
2016-01-21 19:37:29,Donnie,I wouldn't go outside.

2016-01-25 04:58:08,Frank,Any sign of Buckaroo?
2016-01-26 17:45:27,Donnie,"Should I E-mail you?  Should I put this on your ""action item list?"""
2016-01-27 05:38:34,Donnie,"Ruben, my God, I ought to put you on report."
2016-01-29 20:13:22,Donnie,You ever get 'em?
2016-02-02 19:30:51,Donnie,They won't kill it....
2016-02-04 01:03:53,Donnie,You hear me?  Ben?
2016-02-04 08:18:56,Frank,Like what?
2016-02-06 01:01:34,Donnie,Okay...that would be cool sometime.  How 'bout tomorrow?
2016-02-07 07:55:24,Frank,Better go on back and get some more sleep. You'll need it later on.
2016-02-07 13:40:04,Frank,Because it can't. It's dead.
2016-02-08 22:13:27,Frank,"Gosh, you scored!  Look at all those goodies!"
2016-02-09 16:39:37,Frank,"Larry, can I borrow your car keys?"
2016-02-10 01:22:12,Frank,Are you sure about this?
2016-02-10 03:38:02,Donnie,"When I wasn't so miserable I used to sell pigs. Begging your pardon, I was more honest than my holy"
2016-02-10 12:30:58,Donnie,"Hello, Ilia."
2016-02-12 11:27:45,Frank,What do you mean? You're Rita.
2016-02-14 09:19:09,Donnie,Can you not be violent?
2016-02-14 22:34:01,Frank,I was just playing...we were playing just playing around.
2016-02-15 20:23:10,Donnie,"You're damn right it incensed me, the miserable bastard. He also said the kikes and the niggers have"
2016-02-17 00:46:15,Donnie,"He was a town marshal... one night he surprised two burglars, coming out the back of a drugstore..."
2016-02-18 10:10:06,Donnie,You really had other offers?
2016-02-18 10:13:36,Frank,Don't chuck my clothes out!
2016-02-20 05:24:35,Frank,I don't think this is any time to be funny...
2016-02-20 18:20:49,Donnie,Broomsticks instead of tail guns.
2016-02-20 23:39:37,Frank,An evil petting zoo?
2016-02-21 07:32:47,Frank,"You mean to sit there and tell me that your local takes in sixty-five thousand, five hundred dollars"
2016-02-21 13:33:47,Donnie,Bye-bye.
2016-02-21 15:15:38,Donnie,You're scared.
2016-02-22 02:13:49,Donnie,I hate the storm. I hate it!
2016-02-23 06:02:42,Donnie,"I've got to hand it to the British, David. You know what those guys are?  Decent.  Tell me, Herr Dr."
2016-02-23 19:57:12,Donnie,My God! The Bumstead contracts!!
2016-02-23 23:50:09,Frank,I thought you said you were crap.
2016-02-24 17:01:09,Frank,Can I stay at your place?
2016-02-25 19:32:26,Donnie,I emptied it.
2016-02-26 09:52:29,Donnie,I knew it! I knew a night's rest wasn't possible in this house!  Hubert!
2016-02-26 10:28:21,Donnie,You did this -- overnight?
2016-02-27 13:19:08,Frank,Why didn't you tell us your boyfriend was Principal Collins?
2016-02-27 13:50:22,Frank,Thanks for your help... good luck.
2016-02-28 12:44:48,Frank,"Come Llewellyn, don't tarry."

2016-02-29 14:13:35,Frank,Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.
2016-02-29 23:41:02,Frank,"But that's okay, Liz, you're the one with the steady job, you pay all the bills. I'm just an unemplo"

2016-03-04 13:09:45,Donnie,One more turn...
2016-03-04 16:39:38,Donnie,What?
2016-03-05 07:47:06,Frank,Time's up. Any last words of wisdom?
2016-03-05 14:32:17,Donnie,"You do understand that there's absolutely no way I could ever be attracted to you, right?"
2016-03-05 14:57:31,Frank,"Shoot him, Nicky. Not that we really mean it. But where does he live?"
2016-03-06 09:11:35,Donnie,No. Just pool.
2016-03-06 13:23:52,Frank,Yeah.
2016-03-06 23:27:24,Frank,Will you be friend for always?
2016-03-07 12:04:26,Donnie,"Well, in that event, it would be good manners on the part of the other man to let him have her."
2016-03-08 00:17:29,Donnie,"Grapple, Biker's bottle, hairspray, black turtleneck, Pocket Fisherman, acid, collapsible yardstick,"
2016-03-08 00:59:00,Donnie,Hello Marylin.
2016-03-08 01:55:31,Frank,But -- how'd you know it was mine?
2016-03-08 21:18:55,Frank,"A monster. I know, I know."
2016-03-09 15:43:17,Frank,So?
2016-03-11 13:34:41,Donnie,Maybe we should've tried to hop it.
2016-03-11 16:50:14,Donnie,"We were friends. I trusted him. I should have known it was weird. But, then again I was weird."
2016-03-12 16:34:21,Frank,The con...!  Oh my God.
2016-03-13 01:18:06,Frank,"A for effort, Nick, honestly, A for effort and an honorary degree. I'm surprised you never escaped f"
2016-03-14 20:43:20,Donnie,Good! It'll save me the trouble of repeating myself. He's not fucking driving you!

2016-03-18 16:36:23,Donnie,"""Our"" car, Walter?"
2016-03-18 19:14:37,Frank,She'll move away.
2016-03-19 17:06:57,Donnie,What do we do now?
2016-03-20 08:29:35,Donnie,"There's four other angles, man, we haven't even--"
2016-03-20 15:32:28,Frank,"<u>Miss Kreutz</u>, excuse me, but you entered into a fraudulent marriage in an effort to circumvent"
2016-03-22 17:07:11,Donnie,You know what I mean. This car -- and you. Nobody walks around like that. Milk?
2016-03-22 17:34:29,Frank,"In life, the decisions that haunt you are the ones where you just don't know... where right or wrong"
2016-03-23 05:58:22,Frank,Who does Clark Kent think he is anyway! He never even said good night!
2016-03-23 14:43:54,Frank,Be my guest. What you got?
2016-03-24 03:52:06,Frank,"And yet you would have killed him to save my life.  You have a sense of honor, Vincent, that I can't"
2016-03-27 00:29:21,Frank,You know how to work this thing?
2016-03-27 20:33:54,Donnie,"My father built the house where I was born with his own hands.  Oh, it wasn't a big house ..."
2016-03-29 01:17:11,Donnie,I come here because Marty needs a friend.
2016-03-31 04:09:13,Donnie,"Joe, I thought I was gonna be all right by now, I just need a little more --"
2016-03-31 15:48:54,Donnie,"Oliver's pet,  I'm sure it would be the first thing he'd grab if we ever had a fire."
2016-03-31 18:17:32,Donnie,Your last name.
2016-04-01 18:03:33,Frank,Is he next?  Do you drag him into your little room?  Where is it?  Is this it?
2016-04-02 06:35:03,Donnie,"Please, Anne Marie, you being here only complicates things."
2016-04-03 22:34:43,Donnie,"Oooh, I love those."
2016-04-04 22:43:59,Frank,Yeah. Johnny Friendly and my brother had other ideas.
2016-04-06 22:57:11,Frank,Huh?...Oh God...What time is it?
2016-04-07 17:15:27,Donnie,"Reed. I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked."
2016-04-08 00:37:46,Donnie,Oh. Jesus.
2016-04-08 02:44:08,Frank,So you're just the thing we need.
2016-04-08 04:21:25,Donnie,"Mr. Sheldrake? Oh, yes. Very."
2016-04-09 10:17:33,Frank,"Kat, I'm in paradise. I don't ever want to leave."
2016-04-10 12:19:28,Frank,Hello.
2016-04-11 00:51:23,Frank,I'm in your applied theories class. We're all down at the Math and Science building.

2016-04-14 15:32:38,Frank,Like a hand?
2016-04-15 20:15:05,Frank,"You're really pure, you know?  You got a perfect record.  You never used that stuff to ruin your bod"
2016-04-15 23:29:11,Frank,Forget I said wife.
2016-04-16 16:47:55,Frank,I just saw her.
2016-04-16 18:29:45,Donnie,That’s when I realized I wanted to be a doctor.
2016-04-16 18:46:43,Donnie,"Then maybe I saw an old message. There are a lot of them on my desk, you know."
2016-04-17 00:04:03,Frank,Robert Paulson?
2016-04-17 03:27:08,Frank,You want to talk about the baby don't you?
2016-04-18 07:16:39,Donnie,Hey--they actually found the place!
2016-04-18 15:46:30,Donnie,What for?
2016-04-20 17:34:16,Donnie,"You have been given a higher form of happiness. The happiness you feel by serving others, by inspiri"
2016-04-21 01:05:27,Donnie,We can't afford too many surprises.
2016-04-21 03:37:44,Donnie,"It isn't over, is it, Conner?"
2016-04-21 08:04:54,Donnie,Is he....?
2016-04-22 17:14:23,Frank,He looks like a terrific kid.
2016-04-22 18:12:22,Donnie,I'm the librarian.  I've always been the librarian.

2016-04-23 19:42:21,Frank,What?
2016-04-23 21:16:38,Donnie,We're not going to make the storage room!
2016-04-23 22:01:12,Frank,I have to admit there was a moment there when --
2016-04-24 08:40:35,Donnie,Dr. Soong must have found it unnecessary in later versions.
2016-04-24 18:01:05,Donnie,Get <u>out</u> of here!
2016-04-24 22:01:06,Frank,Nice way to help a colleague in trouble.
2016-04-25 10:35:49,Donnie,Leave.
2016-04-25 19:37:48,Donnie,One more?
2016-04-25 22:57:59,Donnie,"Just cool down, son.  I ain't accusing you of anything.  Serves Toby right to get his ass whooped. I"
2016-04-27 12:59:24,Donnie,Shurrup!
2016-04-29 01:45:01,Donnie,Would you mind saying that into your bag...?
2016-04-29 03:27:59,Donnie,"Maybe we should take a little nap, see what happens?"
2016-04-30 15:51:31,Donnie,"Beth, look, can I trust you with a little secret?"
2016-05-02 03:30:40,Donnie,"You tight with the D.A., trash?"
2016-05-06 04:38:13,Donnie,Or like maybe he was baby sitting a problem child for the Navy.
2016-05-06 08:43:54,Frank,"Oh, that was fun. Let's play something together."
2016-05-08 04:19:26,Donnie,Uh-huh.
2016-05-08 13:44:38,Frank,White House switchboard. How may I direct your call.
2016-05-09 11:28:46,Frank,Can I see what you have so far?
2016-05-09 20:46:31,Donnie,"My God, you've grown up."
2016-05-09 21:57:38,Frank,"Yeah, she's okay."
2016-05-10 08:21:45,Donnie,You take cream or sugar?
2016-05-10 14:12:02,Frank,What was it like?
2016-05-10 19:22:32,Frank,"You don't mind if I go instead, do you?"
2016-05-11 10:52:26,Donnie,...it's too damn risky.
2016-05-11 15:54:28,Donnie,I'll pay you back.
2016-05-12 15:42:38,Frank,Yes?
2016-05-13 03:02:25,Donnie,Oh.  Sorry.  I was thinking.
2016-05-13 07:17:25,Donnie,You jerking off or just pissed?
2016-05-14 15:01:06,Frank,Steady on.
2016-05-15 14:23:07,Donnie,No.  Johnnie's got it.  All I got to do is get it back.
2016-05-16 03:50:35,Frank,"You keep staring at that watch as if your life depended on it, Doctor.."
2016-05-16 14:53:59,Frank,"No way.  Everybody's going sailing. If you don't want to take me, just say so."
2016-05-17 20:09:58,Frank,Hello?
2016-05-18 11:15:35,Donnie,I've already told you what I thought.
2016-05-18 21:57:32,Donnie,What?
2016-05-21 00:11:11,Frank,Walter?
2016-05-22 04:58:05,Donnie,Your slave?
2016-05-23 05:29:02,Frank,From what budget?
2016-05-24 02:21:30,Frank,"...I never meet people like you. I'm a garbageman of the human condition. I deal with trash, mostly,"
2016-05-24 03:24:26,Donnie,You're one of Stravanavitch's men.
2016-05-24 14:57:05,Frank,I'd l-like to answer the question.
2016-05-24 23:36:02,Frank,You call.
2016-05-25 19:58:07,Frank,"Yeah, that's right."
2016-05-28 10:15:42,Donnie,This is how you're spending my time? Having a sock hop?
2016-05-28 14:21:42,Frank,It's only the end of June.
2016-05-29 02:06:36,Frank,"Now, touch me...  ...here."

2016-06-09 10:08:43,Frank,These will be very useful.  At least we won't have to go digging around in closets with our bare han
2016-06-10 01:29:48,Donnie,"Hey, yes! Hey, Pony, man! Great concert tonight!"
2016-06-10 07:29:37,Frank,This is good. Little hints of clove.

2016-06-10 23:32:48,Frank,"Well, it isn't much, but if you insist, here's this week's."

2016-06-11 05:07:57,Donnie,Holy-moly. These boys're a hit!
2016-06-11 23:37:13,Frank,Can you swim?
2016-06-12 08:37:42,Frank,How did you meet her?
2016-06-13 03:34:08,Donnie,You wouldn't be sitting here if you didn't halfway believe me.

2016-06-16 21:09:55,Donnie,"There's nothing in here, sir.  They got away with it."
2016-06-17 15:25:19,Donnie,"They met at the Empire State Building, only they didn't. Never mind."
2016-06-17 21:59:54,Frank,Have you tried?
2016-06-18 04:20:55,Donnie,Try.
2016-06-19 03:15:32,Frank,"Hello, Mr. Gayle. I'm Phil Wurlitzer. We talked on the phone. It's a pleasure to meet you."
2016-06-20 05:23:20,Frank,Blood.
2016-06-20 07:45:07,Frank,Something was rattling around. Some loose tools.
2016-06-20 08:33:24,Frank,"You're absolutely right. I'm the first to admit it. If this were a scary movie, I'd be the prime sus"

2016-08-05 01:18:40,Frank,You afraid of the dark?
2016-08-05 18:13:01,Frank,I'm not sure. My guess is that's what Sid wants us to think.
2016-08-07 04:28:36,Frank,I really thought we had something special going. I can't tell you what a disappointment you've turne
2016-08-07 10:21:50,Frank,That spoke to you?
2016-08-08 07:12:08,Donnie,Hello!
2016-08-09 08:41:34,Donnie,I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?
2016-08-09 14:44:54,Donnie,I had the measles once -- and she stayed right by me every minute.

2016-08-14 12:45:15,Donnie,Where's the old bag I sometimes call Mommy?
2016-08-14 16:54:29,Donnie,Where does he get off to talk that way to a working man?  It's not...
2016-08-15 06:35:20,Frank,Here.  Been an interestin' evening.
2016-08-15 11:06:30,Frank,"The ink on your divorce isn't dry. Your children see you on weekends; your oldest boy, Michael Franc"
2016-08-18 01:26:42,Frank,"I'm the kind of man likes to know who's buying their drinks, Lloyd."
2016-08-18 12:40:16,Donnie,"Even if it offended someone, I wouldn't eat a fish eye."
2016-08-18 12:54:25,Frank,"Hungry? After twelve years in the Burmese jungle.  I am starving, Lady Agatha -- starving for a whit"
2016-08-18 14:34:49,Frank,Huh?
2016-08-21 11:54:06,Frank,Okay...

2016-08-26 08:04:17,Frank,Of <u>mercy</u>...off...
2016-08-26 09:55:02,Donnie,"Aaaahhhh, the portal!"
2016-08-26 14:10:49,Donnie,...small town.  I suppose.  You have to make your own fun.
2016-08-27 03:29:53,Donnie,Would you put some of your singing in this for the baby?
2016-08-30 02:57:05,Frank,You want this ticket?
2016-08-30 21:58:40,Frank,Take care.
2016-08-31 01:56:11,Donnie,"My hair's kind of a mess, isn't it?"
2016-09-01 02:09:51,Frank,Wouldn't this whole thing be a little safer in the daytime?
2016-09-02 13:17:49,Frank,"What is it, Miss Vivian?"
2016-09-03 01:12:39,Donnie,Are you <u>crazy</u>?
2016-09-03 13:24:41,Donnie,"Oh, you...  ...ennh."
2016-09-04 18:08:16,Frank,"A monster?  But he built this for the woman he loved, like the Taj Mahal."
2016-09-05 03:22:50,Frank,"Theo, what would you do if you couldn't bowl?"
2016-09-05 18:55:06,Frank,... I understand ...
2016-09-05 22:00:07,Donnie,What?
2016-09-07 17:05:52,Frank,Yeah. Everybody's talkin' about it. They're makin' a big deal out of it.
2016-09-07 23:48:20,Donnie,God-Damn you!
2016-09-08 08:38:43,Donnie,"Good night, beautiful."
2016-09-10 03:45:37,Frank,Down at the station?
2016-09-11 01:57:55,Frank,There's three.  The first is 1983. Lionel Baines.  The Boston...
2016-09-12 00:44:36,Donnie,"Yeah, she came by last night. Shaking like a junkie, wanting me to make a copy of some clip."
2016-09-14 07:54:52,Frank,I hope to God that dog is happy.
2016-09-15 03:12:13,Donnie,"I promised him a new uniform when we re-opened.  And you'll get one, too."
2016-09-15 06:53:19,Donnie,"This one's interesting.  Berlin, 1939, a flower cart took off by itself and rolled approximately hal"
2016-09-16 22:42:08,Donnie,Those fuckin' deadbeats...
2016-09-17 16:27:24,Frank,I made a mistake.
2016-09-18 18:07:32,Frank,"You in business with those guys or what?  I wouldn't want a problem for the establishment, Bern."
2016-09-18 20:40:37,Frank,I hope this prick doesn't run.  My knees are killing me.  Stay behind me.
2016-09-20 14:39:38,Donnie,Before we go in I gotta tell you this isn't going to be pretty.
2016-09-21 01:10:32,Donnie,"Yeah, I understand he's been up here the last six weeks."
2016-09-21 20:08:15,Frank,"I can't believe this, I haven't gotten more than my hand in six weeks and now this shit. Why not Mar"
2016-09-21 20:17:30,Donnie,"Some other time, George."
2016-09-22 21:49:16,Frank,What?
2016-09-23 03:22:25,Donnie,"Not quite -- it seems.  Goodbye, Jeff."
2016-09-23 11:48:03,Donnie,"Clemenza promised them nothing, he hated the sonsuvbitches."
2016-09-23 17:39:39,Frank,I'm glad you asked... To me the most important qualities of a Galaxy Explorer are loyalty...
2016-09-24 03:32:18,Frank,I'm not rambling.
2016-09-24 14:17:01,Donnie,Do you understand why I came here?
2016-09-24 18:23:16,Frank,"But if you didn't rebuild the time machine, how did I go back in time in the first place?"
2016-09-25 01:10:47,Donnie,Nice to meet you.  If you don't mind me asking you - how old are you?
2016-09-25 11:45:01,Frank,Protomatter. An unstable substance which every ethical scientist in the galaxy has denounced as dang
2016-09-26 03:33:32,Donnie,"Will it be possible to have my dog, Bijou, sent here?  I was not allowed to bring her and I love her"
2016-09-26 19:31:27,Frank,So what was that other word for Human... Slow ka?
2016-09-26 21:33:19,Donnie,It was for my report.
2016-09-27 15:27:44,Frank,Did you have sex before you were married?
2016-09-28 13:50:17,Frank,You used me as bait?!
2016-09-29 00:46:17,Donnie,Sergeant Hoffman from Barrack 4.
2016-09-30 17:13:09,Donnie,"Hey, look, the satanists are leaving!"
2016-10-01 00:47:29,Frank,"No, I gotta admit this is peculiar.  Did you have a light burning or something."
2016-10-01 02:34:16,Frank,"Oh, it is."
2016-10-01 14:18:35,Frank,Brandon.
2016-10-03 04:20:51,Frank,But you know how to drive?
2016-10-03 10:54:50,Donnie,Tie it to both ankles -- Leave two feet slack.
2016-10-04 02:45:47,Frank,So what should we do?
2016-10-04 14:54:14,Donnie,What's this?
2016-10-06 11:16:11,Frank,Rebecca -- we shattered a man's life in open court.
2016-10-07 19:12:23,Donnie,I think he's doing Dolly.
2016-10-09 02:13:04,Frank,Report.
2016-10-09 02:42:35,Frank,How the hell did you do that?
2016-10-09 02:47:07,Frank,Beth you're losing it.  C'mon.
2016-10-09 04:30:05,Donnie,So whenever we want...
2016-10-09 14:36:52,Donnie,"...developed between the three of us. We're kindda in this together, don't ya think?"
2016-10-10 13:35:07,Donnie,"Why, no—I—  Yes . . . I guess I will."
2016-10-10 14:07:25,Frank,What are we going to do with him?
2016-10-11 11:14:01,Donnie,This has nothing to do with me! She went up by herself. Yeah I tell them don't go on the roof! They
2016-10-11 21:40:18,Frank,You're such a little lap dog. He's got killer printed all over his forehead.
2016-10-12 01:05:03,Donnie,Should do something to them.
2016-10-12 02:20:27,Frank,"Gosh, what was everybody talking about?"
2016-10-12 04:10:20,Donnie,"You see, five minutes ago you said you loved me and now you hate me... but I prefer this!"
2016-10-12 10:12:29,Frank,But..How could that happen?
2016-10-12 10:19:40,Donnie,When my Shi'ite friends saw that they had shot an American they were very apologetic.  Turns out we'
2016-10-12 13:03:47,Frank,What's that mean?
2016-10-12 21:53:13,Frank,"Oh, Christ!"
2016-10-13 09:06:39,Frank,I don't think people even noticed. I thought the ceremony was perfect.
2016-10-13 18:50:56,Donnie,And I you.
2016-10-13 20:30:57,Frank,"You said ""the Commander."
2016-10-13 22:01:37,Donnie,Look at these. What are these?
2016-10-14 09:30:10,Donnie,"Oh, that's great.  We killed Jake because you heard him talk about some money that you've never seen"
2016-10-14 20:04:26,Donnie,"Mission accomplished.  Well done, men.  Pack it up, we're going home."
2016-10-15 02:23:34,Frank,I got the item.
2016-10-15 09:16:58,Frank,"It's just not your day, is it Rosemary?"
2016-10-16 19:02:06,Frank,"Oh, I-I left it at your house."
2016-10-16 19:15:11,Frank,I want the rest of the pictures.
2016-10-17 08:04:43,Donnie,Set down in there.
2016-10-18 03:45:17,Frank,Hello.
2016-10-18 06:40:41,Donnie,Uh... at least fifty.
2016-10-18 18:56:31,Frank,"All day since you and Betty left. Brother Minister, I have to level with you. They gave me a mission"
2016-10-18 20:53:58,Frank,"Maybe you're right. But it's still my command, and I have leeway to abort when I feel there is an un"
2016-10-20 21:11:33,Frank,You're Pam?
2016-10-21 05:45:21,Frank,"Oh, I was just going to..."
2016-10-22 05:31:53,Donnie,You want to go out there --  get out of this for a second?
2016-10-23 14:05:05,Frank,Of course I am.
2016-10-23 22:00:47,Donnie,Do I make you horny?
2016-10-24 08:25:17,Donnie,He didn't join them. They joined him.
2016-10-24 23:06:23,Frank,The hell I don't.
2016-10-25 07:38:32,Frank,And you... are you not also afraid?
2016-10-25 13:15:46,Frank,What you going to do?
2016-10-25 18:45:56,Frank,Hello?
2016-10-26 17:48:39,Donnie,Go away.
2016-10-26 19:54:39,Frank,"As your attorney, I advise you to tell me where you put the goddamn mescaline."
2016-10-28 06:58:59,Frank,"Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE?"
2016-10-28 09:27:05,Donnie,Taking the book along?
2016-10-28 17:39:33,Frank,Let's open it.
2016-10-29 00:12:20,Donnie,I know how I'd feel if mine went out. Almost like losing a friend.
2016-10-29 17:04:40,Donnie,"I just admire your maturity, that's all.  I mean, there are people who would find that kind of perfe"
2016-10-31 08:43:34,Donnie,Hello...?
2016-10-31 21:27:57,Frank,"Any word, Kip -- ?"
2016-11-01 13:06:39,Donnie,What's happening?
2016-11-02 01:56:35,Frank,What are they for?
2016-11-02 08:17:26,Donnie,"Good argument for gun-control.  What are you going after, rhino?"
2016-11-02 20:23:09,Frank,Insane. Nurseries are better than any mother could be.
2016-11-04 05:47:21,Frank,Then why'd you do it?
2016-11-04 16:31:34,Frank,Where did you get that?
2016-11-05 15:46:41,Frank,"Mr. Mayor, it's a pretty simple choice. You can believe Mr. Pecker here ..."
2016-11-06 18:04:39,Donnie,I wouldn't do that if I was you.
2016-11-06 19:48:00,Donnie,So what do you want?... An autograph.
2016-11-07 16:05:03,Frank,...I'm sorry.
2016-11-08 00:45:00,Donnie,It's doing what?
2016-11-10 16:50:13,Donnie,Anything. Strong.
2016-11-11 13:41:40,Frank,"I'm tellin' you, those cops been fuckin' wit your mind. They turn black against black, that's how th"
2016-11-12 14:30:40,Donnie,"I mean, it's not a problem or anything, but -- I'm just a little unclear on what those things are."
2016-11-13 20:14:43,Frank,And--
2016-11-14 08:03:33,Donnie,He has experience in related work. A great deal of it.
2016-11-14 15:32:32,Donnie,I think that you and I are natural enemies.
2016-11-16 00:24:29,Donnie,"Do you remember Beethoven?  The Beatles?  Movies, books, restaurants, friends?"
2016-11-16 05:18:04,Donnie,"Well, that's ridiculous.  If the teleprinter and radio links are out of order, just pick up a phone"
2016-11-16 14:35:46,Donnie,"Here, right around Centaurus A."
2016-11-16 15:57:48,Frank,You are unharmed?
2016-11-19 16:21:01,Donnie,What do you have? A Pluto call back?
2016-11-21 15:34:42,Donnie,"My name is Miss Ho Kym.  Day-Day just trying to be a smart ass.  Nice to meet you, Craig.  Are you '"
2016-11-23 03:30:16,Frank,Damn.
2016-11-23 15:17:44,Donnie,Did you have my home phone number?
2016-11-25 20:21:56,Donnie,I bet.
2016-11-26 07:29:38,Donnie,I don't know where he is.
2016-11-26 22:38:22,Donnie,You want me to pump?
2016-11-27 23:51:20,Frank,He said if we lent him money h would tell us about a secret beach.
2016-11-28 09:56:21,Donnie,Who's a killer?
2016-11-28 12:16:57,Donnie,Holding hands?
2016-11-28 21:49:43,Frank,"She stayed in the cab, what's she gonna do? But she stiffed me. A real skunk."
2016-11-28 23:56:35,Donnie,"Goodness, no!"
2016-11-29 00:04:09,Frank,Yes.
2016-11-29 00:27:37,Frank,You still haven't kissed her yet ? Don't lie.
2016-11-30 07:44:50,Frank,And a social life.
2016-11-30 07:58:08,Frank,Quiet.  Would I get the loans?
2016-11-30 11:22:36,Donnie,Nervous?
2016-11-30 19:49:51,Frank,Don't talk about Elaine.
2016-11-30 20:25:19,Frank,"This I gotta see...  ...the ""make up an excuse and stop"" part."
2016-11-30 22:06:06,Donnie,I suppose you don't believe me.
2016-12-01 03:02:18,Frank,"No, sir.  I mean I didn't think you hadn't given it a lot of thought."
2016-12-02 21:32:03,Frank,<u>Get on the floor</u>!
2016-12-03 04:20:48,Donnie,"The Atreides will be leaving Caladan soon, Baron, and I have here your answer from Duke Leto."
2016-12-03 08:08:46,Frank,I'm trying to find a style of my own.  Do you really like them?
2016-12-03 11:31:14,Frank,It's more or less how it sounds. Sometimes it's not pretty to watch. Some horses fight it real hard.
2016-12-03 13:41:30,Frank,"Uh, sir..."
2016-12-03 19:38:17,Donnie,When worlds collide.
2016-12-04 08:56:10,Donnie,Put it in the middle of the room!
2016-12-04 17:46:38,Frank,I know the Piazza di Spagna. What time?
2016-12-05 00:28:20,Frank,What's her first name?
2016-12-05 16:24:52,Donnie,No mortal weapons can kill this creature. He is not of this world.
2016-12-06 11:47:25,Frank,You're kidding.
2016-12-06 17:51:59,Frank,No --
2016-12-07 07:15:36,Frank,Who is he?
2016-12-08 02:56:06,Frank,Mitchell's out of his mind now. Martha just put her head through a plate-glass window.
2016-12-08 22:54:17,Donnie,That too.
2016-12-10 00:43:34,Frank,I miss my kids.
2016-12-11 17:15:30,Frank,CONTINUED
2016-12-11 17:47:52,Frank,That's what I was going to ask you.  he's disappeared!
2016-12-11 18:06:39,Donnie,"All right, I'll go up there and take care of this myself.  You look awful, son. Go find yourself som"
2016-12-12 11:03:13,Donnie,The desire for vengeance... can be a poison.
2016-12-13 02:37:49,Frank,"It was lovely being you being Malkovich, my dear. I'd never seen the passionate side of sweet Maxine"
2016-12-13 02:48:45,Frank,Hell. Ten?
2016-12-13 08:53:52,Frank,They've all stopped at the same time.
2016-12-14 19:07:03,Donnie,My leg is falling asleep.
2016-12-14 22:41:47,Frank,Well.  You've been introduced to the symphonic range of...
2016-12-17 09:14:25,Donnie,Sir?
2016-12-17 19:14:53,Donnie,"Then it's Godspeed, Screwball."
2016-12-20 05:43:14,Frank,"If looks could kill, I'm dead..."
2016-12-20 22:23:09,Donnie,"Hey, Sweden!!!"
2016-12-21 14:46:42,Donnie,I can't do this.
2016-12-22 09:46:56,Frank,Nothing.  I guess I just wanted to thank you.
2016-12-22 10:24:17,Frank,"What are you <u>doing</u>? You just can't go.....Besides, she'd never drink anything that looks like"
2016-12-22 11:51:19,Donnie,It's getting so a girl can't step out of the room without being discussed by a bunch of old ladies.
2016-12-23 00:44:27,Donnie,Reinstatement at full salary. Back pay covering the period of unemployment and...
2016-12-23 12:50:58,Donnie,"Yeah, where am I?"
2016-12-24 03:08:55,Frank,"Sorry, Luv.  I've got a date."
2016-12-24 04:26:08,Frank,No.
2016-12-24 07:28:37,Frank,And you said there'd be some of me left.  Nobody's going to know me in this getup.
2016-12-25 03:02:33,Donnie,"Sure, why not."
2016-12-26 16:33:13,Donnie,"About cholesterol...You know what I know, you'd have the seafood."
2016-12-27 20:07:08,Donnie,"I'm sorry, I didn't..."
2016-12-28 06:53:54,Frank,Damn dog stuck his nose in on my rabbits and they ganged up on him. I swear that dog's an idiot.
2016-12-29 08:23:14,Donnie,"What's that, a gram?"
2016-12-31 00:29:37,Donnie,I'll get the boots.
2016-12-31 03:29:26,Donnie,"Uh, oh. Now it's time."
2016-12-31 17:00:38,Donnie,What makes you so sure?
2017-01-01 21:57:32,Donnie,Do you know his number?
2017-01-02 01:18:57,Frank,"Do you realize, Mr. Gardiner, that more people will be watching you tonight than all those who have"
2017-01-02 12:00:22,Frank,Yeah?
2017-01-04 08:41:34,Frank,You needn't worry. It's over and done with. A long time ago.
2017-01-04 21:23:04,Frank,Don't tell me that was any meteor shower.
2017-01-05 05:55:03,Frank,We ain't got no Beck's.
2017-01-05 07:22:07,Frank,"So do I.  as a matter of fact, I spent three years at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music."
2017-01-05 08:14:52,Frank,You are beautiful.  You know you are.
2017-01-06 04:44:14,Frank,"It was covered with Mr. Fasil's fingerprints, but none of his blood."
2017-01-08 16:35:40,Frank,You should have.
2017-01-09 03:20:38,Frank,That's two more than the Fantastic Four.
2017-01-09 14:41:07,Donnie,"Hey look, it's our teacher."
2017-01-11 00:40:35,Donnie,Tell him I'm on vacation.  That I won't be back for two weeks.
2017-01-11 01:58:51,Donnie,Are they heavy?
2017-01-11 21:01:02,Donnie,How?  Do something to hurt them. Where they live.
2017-01-12 05:15:53,Frank,"Come on, that's what you do. You handle more than eighty percent of the intelligence workload. You'r"
2017-01-13 05:21:40,Donnie,You fucking build it!  Men come...
2017-01-13 11:13:26,Frank,Are you prepared to put that in writing?
2017-01-13 17:23:49,Donnie,It's his work.
2017-01-13 22:50:02,Donnie,That's not always a healthy way to be...
2017-01-14 10:57:58,Donnie,Do something.
2017-01-16 03:26:58,Frank,No.
2017-01-16 11:10:24,Frank,How'd you get the picture?
2017-01-17 20:40:00,Frank,I'd just like to have a word with her.
2017-01-19 07:11:47,Donnie,Quintus is overly idealistic.
2017-01-19 21:24:59,Donnie,It is Johnny.  He came all the way from California to be at the wedding.
2017-01-20 05:38:31,Donnie,What?
2017-01-20 07:16:57,Donnie,You've never heard anybody say anything about either movie?
2017-01-20 17:11:07,Donnie,"But how do I...how do I do a film called ""The Old Mill,"" when I don't have an old mill?"
2017-01-20 21:30:13,Frank,"Annie, what is it?"
2017-01-23 01:12:44,Frank,"Because, my dear Will, if this Pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the full moon, he might g"
2017-01-24 00:53:29,Donnie,Accidental?
2017-01-25 14:32:21,Frank,You're kidding --
2017-01-25 23:36:38,Frank,"This is great, honey.  The orange. Has it got a little vodka in it? Like that Finnish stuff, orange"
2017-01-26 04:42:20,Frank,"Nothin' complex about it. Del's dead, Betty's gone. She's probably dead, too."
2017-01-26 14:36:38,Donnie,You're not doing the extra credit problems.
2017-01-27 16:38:15,Donnie,I cannot stay.
2017-01-29 01:39:11,Frank,"You know, I'm not sure I could live anywhere else.  The nights are always so peaceful and quiet."
2017-01-30 15:38:14,Frank,And you know what else?
2017-01-30 21:17:07,Donnie,How long ago did this guy retire?
2017-01-31 03:45:35,Donnie,I had to ask.  I apologize.
2017-02-01 00:17:02,Frank,I'll tell you what makes sense ! Air strikes ! White Phosphorus ! Napalm ! We'll bomb the shit out o
2017-02-01 06:31:12,Frank,You want me to pump?
2017-02-03 09:59:19,Frank,You jumped in?
2017-02-03 14:44:01,Donnie,Sandro ...What's the matter?
2017-02-03 21:39:00,Frank,You're a princess...
2017-02-05 03:22:07,Frank,Where's Mary?
2017-02-05 13:22:30,Frank,You think I could make it to the Show as a manager?
2017-02-05 19:32:28,Donnie,"Look, you need me to sign an invoice or somethin'?"
2017-02-06 21:54:38,Donnie,Will it work?
2017-02-07 02:47:22,Frank,I can smell carcinogens and industrial pollutants on your skin that have not been known here for --
2017-02-07 19:52:05,Donnie,That fella come by... Tom.
2017-02-08 00:47:31,Frank,I heard what happened.
2017-02-08 04:09:05,Frank,Fuck you.
2017-02-08 06:54:57,Frank,Uh-huh.
2017-02-08 10:47:44,Donnie,I beg your pardon?
2017-02-09 10:56:48,Donnie,"What? No, I'm not gonna let you just run out of here... You need to talk about what's going on..."
2017-02-10 09:08:07,Donnie,Mm.
2017-02-11 21:58:41,Frank,"Well why the fuck would you want to lie, anyway?"
2017-02-12 01:21:08,Frank,Are you getting tired?
2017-02-12 01:57:42,Donnie,"Cat, you tie onto this manifold.  There's some tanks on the other side; I'm gonna go check them out."
2017-02-12 13:45:54,Frank,She left.  She's gone.
2017-02-14 11:09:09,Donnie,"Behold, good sir! The very first photo of your future child."
2017-02-20 02:23:08,Frank,In your dreams.
2017-02-22 12:07:27,Donnie,I can't do that. I haven't been being fair to Carl. I have to tell you that.
2017-02-22 20:15:20,Frank,But no short-arm inspection. I'm with you there.
2017-02-23 05:42:02,Donnie,"Well, hell, I guess that's it, then, huh? They're scarred for life.  They're gonna start holding up"
2017-02-23 18:10:29,Frank,Who gave it to you?
2017-02-25 13:57:21,Frank,Stop it.
2017-02-25 14:43:27,Frank,Noooo. Free snort. That's it.
2017-02-26 04:35:00,Frank,"Jake, no --"
2017-02-26 07:20:24,Donnie,It's them.  They did this.
2017-02-26 18:20:38,Donnie,"The ""skylight?"" Fool!  It's too high for anybody to climb out the damn skylight..."
2017-02-27 08:33:48,Frank,You can let go of me now. I'm safe. How do they look?
2017-03-01 19:03:40,Frank,"What you want me to want, you mean. What you've decided I ought to have - what you'd want if you wer"
2017-03-01 21:07:05,Donnie,...do we?
2017-03-02 09:45:40,Donnie,Mmm.
2017-03-02 11:19:33,Frank,"If I needed your I.D. and your car and me and my brothers were wanted by the law, I woulda killed yo"
2017-03-05 02:37:55,Donnie,It was his idea.
2017-03-05 07:38:48,Donnie,How close do you have to be?
2017-03-06 04:11:02,Donnie,We've got to turn the faucet off on this thing.  It's out of control ...  You might burden just me w
2017-03-08 02:10:49,Donnie,About a year and a half.
2017-03-08 10:02:07,Frank,Into Stargher.  Inside...
2017-03-08 12:35:26,Frank,"Where are we going?  Look at this. There's the kitty, Ernie. Here, come on, count it, Mary."
2017-03-08 16:34:22,Frank,"Cindy, I've been thinking about this whole friend thing. I never had a friend that cares for me the"

2017-03-11 02:01:55,Frank,You have a lovely voice.
2017-03-11 10:30:12,Frank,I don't know.
2017-03-11 13:02:10,Donnie,I say fuck the motherfucker. We're a professional salvage crew going about our business. What's some
2017-03-11 21:33:07,Frank,"And remember that trip we took to Africa? That safari was so wonderful. Me, you... best of friends.."
2017-03-13 05:42:54,Frank,"Okay.  ""Frankenstein.""  Tell me everything."
2017-03-13 18:40:04,Donnie,What the hell you doin'?
2017-03-14 00:44:48,Donnie,What?
2017-03-14 00:58:30,Donnie,Almost complete withdrawal. She hasn't said a word for nearly two years.
2017-03-14 06:14:02,Frank,It all went so fast.  He was out of his mind and then all of sudden there was this screwdriver.  I o

2017-03-15 02:55:05,Donnie,"Lombard, this is not a Jewish name, is it?"
2017-03-15 13:33:36,Donnie,"I mean, I guess you still think about Nam. Right? I mean --"
2017-03-15 16:46:19,Donnie,That's it?
2017-03-16 00:39:09,Donnie,Yes.....we do ask for....30 to 60 days....
2017-03-16 12:44:16,Frank,You don't have to.  The rabbit's wife sings at an underground Toon revue joint called The Ink & Pain
2017-03-16 15:58:38,Frank,"That's it...?    Come on, guys...life is too short...  You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or y"
2017-03-17 11:04:41,Donnie,Well I didn't know about you until after she was gone.
2017-03-18 07:00:19,Frank,You know Sid Fletcher?
2017-03-18 14:08:43,Frank,What? What does she represent?! What could some cornbread white bitch from Kansas who's dragging our
2017-03-18 18:02:53,Frank,You've made me a happy insurance person.
2017-03-19 04:59:25,Frank,"So it's almost a retroactive decision. So I could, like, let's say, forget about her and when she co"
2017-03-20 02:29:31,Donnie,Josephine.
2017-03-20 08:30:50,Donnie,"You will stay, Doctor -- if you have nothing better to do?"
2017-03-20 13:36:23,Donnie,The clock's already ticking.
2017-03-20 21:50:13,Frank,"No, Mrs. Lampert. His death is registered with the War Department in Washington."
2017-03-21 08:10:19,Frank,That's my good son: but where hast thou been
2017-03-21 17:29:31,Frank,The trees.  The flowers.  Nice.
2017-03-22 01:07:39,Donnie,I think you might just want to do as I say.
2017-03-22 03:54:38,Donnie,"So patience, Thibeau, patience. Trust me."
2017-03-22 12:13:11,Donnie,"Man, I don't think I can do this, Craig. I got the B-G's."
2017-03-23 18:13:37,Frank,Don't ever do that again.
2017-03-24 01:36:57,Frank,What a nice place.
2017-03-24 09:49:28,Frank,"A week's a long time, friend. Anything can happen.  All of it bad."
2017-03-24 22:59:39,Frank,Joel!
2017-03-26 06:08:52,Donnie,"Are you and Hannah seeing each other, James?"
2017-03-27 03:47:30,Frank,Where'd he go??
2017-03-28 00:24:42,Frank,You know how to get there?
2017-03-28 20:01:40,Donnie,I've come to apply for membership in Brolly --
2017-03-30 06:32:49,Frank,I have no idea what you're talking about.
2017-03-30 10:45:07,Frank,"No, Mrs. Lampert."
2017-03-31 09:08:44,Donnie,You heard Mr. Sandefur say before Congress that he believed nicotine was not addictive...?
2017-03-31 14:27:08,Donnie,Just a place.
2017-04-03 01:08:50,Frank,Are you going to remarried Phyllis?
2017-04-03 04:58:32,Donnie,Jesus.
2017-04-03 08:27:54,Donnie,Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.
2017-04-03 09:46:27,Donnie,Dormer.  Still no sign of the bullet that went through Farrell.
2017-04-03 11:06:12,Frank,Good night.
2017-04-04 10:37:38,Frank,Well - a group of us are appearing at the hotel. Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators.
2017-04-04 17:30:52,Frank,Excuse me?
2017-04-04 20:39:13,Donnie,Just sit here for a moment. You seem very upset.
2017-04-05 03:01:14,Donnie,Must be somebody?
2017-04-05 06:54:02,Donnie,"Yeah, and in California you never have to buy fruit 'cause it's all on the trees everywhere you turn"
2017-04-05 18:31:46,Frank,I don't have to look at anything. I don't have --
2017-04-06 05:32:08,Frank,"Don't even think about it, cowboy!"
2017-04-08 08:36:48,Frank,I understand. Christmas -- family and all that --
2017-04-08 13:47:12,Donnie,I want you on call here.
2017-04-08 14:35:58,Frank,Look at the screen. That is William Blake's 'The Great Red Dragon and The Woman Clothed with the Sun
2017-04-08 19:27:27,Frank,"What're you thinking, Jerry?"

2017-04-12 06:29:40,Frank,Because I really suspect Gideon -- and it is always the person you don't suspect.
2017-04-12 12:02:27,Frank,Jesus!
2017-04-13 00:32:57,Donnie,"For crying out loud, a kid's driving the car?!"
2017-04-14 00:13:20,Donnie,I heard you strain when you put the milk in the bag. That milk only weighs about seven pounds.
2017-04-15 16:04:45,Donnie,Who's idea was it?
2017-04-15 19:32:03,Donnie,Did you know... about Raoul?
2017-04-16 03:36:47,Frank,None?
2017-04-16 05:38:40,Donnie,I might have recognized you without the beard.  And you didn't wear glasses on the 'Time' cover!
2017-04-16 22:19:11,Frank,Get ready.  To get <u>really</u> mad.
2017-04-20 02:46:14,Donnie,Look at her! She'll never pass that sanity test tomorrow...
2017-04-20 05:28:46,Donnie,I still don't see how he could be playing chess against you.  There's only enough grids on the map t
2017-04-20 08:47:53,Donnie,I'm not going anywhere until you get this guy out of my head.
2017-04-21 12:44:24,Frank,I'm sorry I was late... I got my hair done... the girl was slow.
2017-04-21 18:49:17,Donnie,Nah.
2017-04-22 04:00:00,Donnie,"When we get Artoo's message to them, you think they'll try to rescue the princess?"
2017-04-22 14:11:37,Frank,My life sucks.
2017-04-23 09:47:57,Donnie,See? There you go again.
2017-04-23 23:02:34,Frank,You're pretty drunk.
2017-04-24 18:39:37,Frank,Right.
2017-04-25 08:18:40,Frank,I said how's your baby...?
2017-04-25 17:42:57,Frank,"You look way pretty, Kim."
2017-04-25 20:00:38,Frank,You all want to lay off?  God.  I hope the Iraqis shoot me; put me out of my misery.
2017-04-26 12:13:23,Frank,Millie left to stay with her sister in Ronkonkoma.
2017-04-26 20:01:43,Frank,"So you see, John, there's no need for a lighthouse. All your friends are here."
2017-04-27 04:32:10,Donnie,Evil.
2017-04-27 12:40:35,Donnie,"We're family, Caesar."
2017-04-27 14:48:42,Donnie,What? What?
2017-04-28 05:13:48,Donnie,Please use your time to familiarize yourself with your new home and if there is anything you need to
2017-04-28 21:13:59,Frank,Who?
2017-04-29 21:31:18,Donnie,"Well, obviously these tests weren't designed for this but fundamentally they're looking for the same"
2017-04-30 04:20:57,Donnie,How did they get it away from him?
2017-04-30 13:47:10,Donnie,Give me your coat.
2017-05-03 06:15:44,Donnie,Be careful.
2017-05-03 21:55:02,Frank,Of course he will. [Beat] What day of the week is it?
2017-05-04 09:10:59,Frank,"I come for the seafood. It's great! Hey... you know what, Mark? I found your wallet the other day. Y"
2017-05-04 23:55:06,Frank,You can't help them.  Right now they're being cocooned just like the others.
2017-05-05 06:37:43,Donnie,Why didn't you eat last night?
2017-05-05 14:42:01,Frank,I said 'got it?'
2017-05-06 03:15:45,Frank,"Oh, Mother!"
2017-05-06 16:09:49,Frank,"Hey, baby, that's where they put me, Sing-Sing.  How'd you know that, you been up?"
2017-05-07 04:59:23,Frank,"I'm trying to help, Duff."
2017-05-07 18:52:24,Frank,"Hell, man, that don't matter. We're loaded. We were big wheels in the black market in Seoul."
2017-05-08 12:04:02,Donnie,I'm hungry.  You've upset my whole day. I haven't eaten.
2017-05-10 03:04:15,Donnie,Yes.
2017-05-10 14:09:57,Frank,I swear it. And he's big and plays football and will beat the shit out of you.
2017-05-11 05:45:53,Donnie,"You, Pearl. You swear too."
2017-05-11 10:34:22,Donnie,"The usual prospects. Convicts, contract killers, murde..."
2017-05-13 17:50:58,Donnie,You saved my -- uh -- life... or whatever... something.
2017-05-14 10:40:18,Frank,"Ahm, well, you know ~ that's a tough question - on one' level I think it ...."
2017-05-14 20:46:04,Donnie,This is a little nuts.
2017-05-15 22:04:33,Frank,What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all?
2017-05-17 06:05:38,Frank,"Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test t"
2017-05-18 06:08:38,Donnie,Stop it!
2017-05-19 12:27:56,Frank,"No, General.  I'm dancing with the war hero."
2017-05-19 13:50:25,Frank,I'm standing most of my day. They're for support.  Didn't see you in church this mornin'.
2017-05-20 05:45:15,Frank,This is my favourite place in the city.
2017-05-20 19:12:47,Frank,"You haven't changed so much as a pair of socks in the years I've known you.  If we've grown apart, t"
2017-05-21 21:45:49,Frank,"Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen."
2017-05-21 22:24:26,Donnie,Then why didn't you help the kid when you were there?
2017-05-23 17:47:15,Donnie,Who else did?  Did Valentin?
2017-05-24 15:55:04,Donnie,"Well, I believe there are at least 30 guns at Sablons."
2017-05-24 17:45:37,Donnie,"You're looking a wee bit green, Thomas."
2017-05-25 02:26:23,Frank,"Well, sure. But he was super-gentle, you know? I mean, he raped me and all, but I guess there's all"
2017-05-25 03:56:19,Donnie,Bitch... You little bitch!
2017-05-25 09:59:28,Frank,Ok.
2017-05-25 13:50:28,Frank,What did Jeffrey's dad say?
2017-05-25 15:45:50,Donnie,Where?
2017-05-25 16:56:42,Frank,"It's okay, really."
2017-05-26 02:54:09,Donnie,"You lived in the man's house what-- seventeen, eighteen years? And you didn't get to know him any be"
2017-05-26 06:11:16,Frank,"Depends on the quote. Let's see -- there's the plane tickets over, import duties, hidden taxes, prof"
2017-05-26 21:51:13,Donnie,J.D.? You seem pretty amused. I thought you were giving up on high school guys.
2017-05-29 03:11:35,Frank,Wait a minute!--They're dancing in the palm court--
2017-05-29 16:22:37,Frank,Nothing wrong with ketchup.
2017-05-30 17:54:59,Donnie,Never mind. You won't have to do anything for me ever again. I'm leaving!
2017-05-30 18:20:35,Donnie,Thanks for your help on the glasses thing.
2017-05-31 09:55:02,Donnie,...I heard it took four days to light for that shot...
2017-06-02 12:37:16,Donnie,...reporting....him... ventriloquism...On a bus
2017-06-03 05:40:13,Donnie,You could have knocked me down with a feather -- Selectman -- me.
2017-06-03 07:19:33,Donnie,Sometimes she's terrific...
2017-06-03 17:35:18,Frank,"You thought that up all by yourself, huh?"
2017-06-05 01:02:46,Donnie,Cigarettes and beer rule! Huh huh.
2017-06-06 16:59:37,Donnie,"Sir. Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to have to wake you. Are you a doctor?"
2017-06-07 09:31:38,Frank,"No, I see Betty as a Midwestern Stoic type. Ice water in her veins. A clear thinker. Probably a Swed"
2017-06-07 09:41:39,Donnie,Right on.
2017-06-07 12:23:46,Donnie,"Well, I don't know... I only been seeing you --"
2017-06-08 12:44:38,Frank,"It won't even hold the one day, Ronnie --"
2017-06-09 05:36:44,Frank,You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed.  It's all right. I'll stay here with you.  It's a
2017-06-10 13:08:01,Donnie,Wait a minute! How'd you know Dieter was coming here?
2017-06-10 13:51:10,Donnie,What.
2017-06-10 21:41:41,Frank,To isolation.  To an armed camp.  To a biblical spoof of a crazed father firing a gun at his only so
2017-06-11 05:27:18,Donnie,...we had a script conference...
2017-06-11 15:11:05,Donnie,You should have tried to get pregnant Marylin -- solidify your position.
2017-06-12 14:34:10,Frank,Mind if I smoke a jay?
2017-06-13 09:47:21,Donnie,Seemed like a good idea.
2017-06-13 16:50:23,Frank,"Make sure there's none on the threads, like this.  Now screw the end-cap on...very gently."
2017-06-13 19:08:58,Donnie,This you?
2017-06-14 22:46:30,Frank,Shut up!
2017-06-18 20:42:16,Frank,This is going to do nothing.
2017-06-19 09:43:52,Frank,"I'll need ten minutes, sir, 'til the radiation dissipates."
2017-06-19 17:44:16,Donnie,Scooby?
2017-06-20 03:33:42,Frank,Honesty through paranoia. Why do you smell like shoe polish?
2017-06-20 05:14:15,Donnie,You saying God give up? Nothing left for us but pour out our own blood?
2017-06-21 13:51:45,Donnie,"What do you say we go for a walk, pal."
2017-06-22 15:56:08,Donnie,Data!
2017-06-23 04:07:35,Frank,"Damn, I wish this thing would go faster."
2017-06-23 16:35:01,Donnie,"It was an unfair fight. He didn't have a chance. I'm taking a real gamble. I loved him for a long, l"
2017-06-23 17:59:39,Frank,"Larry, I'm gonna kill him."
2017-06-25 00:25:35,Frank,You're lying.
2017-06-25 02:36:39,Donnie,I don't know. I'm beginning to feel guilty.
2017-06-25 20:02:51,Frank,How's it going with Gail?
2017-06-26 00:21:40,Frank,Birdy's in the parlor--I'm on long distance here.
2017-06-26 06:03:20,Frank,"You know what I want you to do? Get a couple of guys to dig a hole in the desert, then let 'em show"
2017-06-27 15:10:22,Donnie,I would never miss anything that you had written. You must know that.
2017-06-28 22:47:30,Donnie,"No, I'm not. We were walking off the tennis court, and you know, he was there and me and his wife, a"
2017-06-29 12:41:30,Donnie,"I'll give you a hint.  ""Ohhh, yeah, yeah!""  Comprende?"
2017-06-29 13:26:34,Frank,You call your son Little Chief?
2017-07-01 05:30:18,Donnie,Oh. I saved my first drink to have with you. Here.
2017-07-02 17:38:09,Donnie,"I will, old boy, tomorrow.  Our work is done here.  Just came to say goodbye, and good luck."
2017-07-03 04:48:55,Donnie,No!
2017-07-04 10:59:51,Donnie,"I want you gone, Randall. Settle your affairs. Make it right with those you love. Hell, take 'em wit"
2017-07-05 18:22:51,Frank,For what? Because I'm a dangerous man. Because I know too much about the truth.
2017-07-05 22:43:31,Frank,"A while, I guess."
2017-07-08 22:39:58,Frank,I want to help you.
2017-07-09 12:14:41,Frank,About three.
2017-07-09 12:56:08,Frank,"-- now here's the way it's going to work..Wallis, the shares outstanding are.."
2017-07-10 01:19:34,Donnie,"Not exactly, Linda. I'm not sure where you're going with this --"
2017-07-10 17:52:14,Frank,Strange.
2017-07-12 01:36:38,Frank,I'm pretty nervous. Are you?
2017-07-12 05:23:58,Frank,"There you go, Mr. Brubaker.  Suite 610 in the East Wing."
2017-07-14 18:04:50,Donnie,How 'bout I give you your balls back?
2017-07-16 04:56:41,Donnie,Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married?
2017-07-16 05:00:38,Donnie,The same as always.
2017-07-16 07:07:10,Frank,"I think if you, uh, okay it, you know, assure her that she's gonna be all right, she'll come back."
2017-07-16 10:20:55,Frank,"Well, well, well - got your uniform, eh?"
2017-07-16 14:30:19,Frank,"You okay, Jim? How do you feel?"
2017-07-17 10:45:42,Donnie,"And this is your ""work""?"
2017-07-17 12:46:19,Donnie,Well... they told me that I was an accomplice...
2017-07-17 17:14:20,Frank,"What, switch what?"
2017-07-18 04:32:07,Donnie,"You cannot run from your destiny, Conner."
2017-07-18 10:03:12,Donnie,"She came to me for help.  I should have read it better... I just figured, y'know... another strung-"
2017-07-19 00:25:26,Frank,Of doing the thing.  The dif...the difference.  Between me and Jerry Graff.  Going to business for y
2017-07-22 03:51:18,Donnie,What about my ship?
2017-07-22 16:52:06,Donnie,"Takes a lot out of you, one like this."
2017-07-23 04:34:34,Frank,There've been some calls.
2017-07-23 05:10:13,Frank,You're next move should have been e2- e3.
2017-07-24 21:47:56,Frank,"I love you, Miss Kubelik."
2017-07-25 06:20:55,Frank,"They're finished, they can't help us anymore!  They've done their duty, General Greene, now you do y"
2017-07-26 05:18:05,Donnie,"Julie, wow. I was afraid you left. I was afraid I'd never see you again."
2017-07-26 19:45:50,Donnie,Which one?
2017-07-27 09:51:13,Frank,"I helped him cook the books, Ed. I did do that."
2017-07-27 12:19:09,Frank,It's okay.  I'm game.
2017-07-27 19:18:19,Donnie,"Craig, remember what I told you."
2017-07-28 03:09:12,Frank,This is where we're going!
2017-07-28 11:49:08,Frank,I'm coming with you.
2017-07-28 20:15:06,Frank,What do we do?
2017-07-29 05:19:28,Frank,"Buffy, this is crazy.  What do these guys want?"
2017-07-29 08:35:55,Frank,Anything.  Anything.
2017-07-29 20:18:54,Frank,"You took care of your wife, like you do me?"
2017-07-30 11:01:27,Donnie,My reputation seems to have preceded me.
2017-07-31 10:36:14,Donnie,It's not the taxes I object to. It's all the fines and penalties.
2017-07-31 12:57:04,Donnie,"Maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place, ever think of that?"
2017-08-02 10:40:40,Donnie,Where the hell are you going?
2017-08-03 19:04:49,Donnie,If you could see your way to lending me some cash -
2017-08-03 19:49:18,Donnie,"Like the look of these?  I made them myself, to set him free."
2017-08-03 22:10:04,Frank,How did you know...?
2017-08-04 01:40:27,Donnie,Listen--I took a steak out of the freezer.  I thought we could have a real old-fashioned stag party-
2017-08-04 13:22:38,Donnie,"Smart. Smart. Smart. Think big picture, take your time. I wish I had."
2017-08-05 13:11:48,Frank,"I know. You're bored already. Transplants are yesterday's kishkas, right?"
2017-08-06 03:42:55,Frank,Come dance.
2017-08-06 10:31:46,Frank,You think she sure 'nough your sister?
2017-08-06 14:30:18,Donnie,"Over -- over so soon -- it has just begun.  Oh, the pain."
2017-08-07 01:40:36,Frank,"Zavitz, what? You want your old job back?"
2017-08-07 14:49:03,Donnie,Because your a virgin?
2017-08-08 00:49:50,Donnie,Indeed? Perhaps he will do me a great favor.
2017-08-11 01:57:39,Frank,"""In Washington..."""
2017-08-11 04:48:31,Donnie,I'm sorry.
2017-08-11 20:19:55,Frank,Oh shit...
2017-08-11 20:43:25,Frank,This can't be settled any other way now...I'll take full blame.
2017-08-12 22:03:00,Donnie,Where are we?
2017-08-12 23:53:29,Frank,But there are those who have power over him. I think I'll take this up with the Emperor.
2017-08-15 11:35:04,Frank,"She called you that, too. May I ask why you're here?"
2017-08-16 19:40:47,Frank,"Admiral, I am receiving whale songs."
2017-08-17 03:31:36,Frank,How could I be angry at you when clearly what has happened to me is as God intended?
2017-08-17 20:27:31,Frank,But...
2017-08-18 07:18:14,Frank,Sometimes you just have to -
2017-08-18 15:01:47,Frank,"It's been what, three years?"
2017-08-18 17:47:20,Frank,Where are you going?
2017-08-19 02:48:02,Frank,But they'll be worried about me -- my brother-in-law may be calling the police --
2017-08-19 12:55:00,Donnie,The Fire.
2017-08-20 01:03:37,Donnie,"See you tomorrow, Miss Boatwright."
2017-08-20 04:10:08,Donnie,I was told that my Grandfather was murdered on its main street; and his murderers came to kill my fa
2017-08-20 18:35:34,Frank,Jon ... we just remember how it used to be.  You staying for a while or is this just a piss-stop?
2017-08-21 04:52:07,Frank,Where are my children?
2017-08-21 05:20:27,Donnie,Vada? VADA?? What happened??
2017-08-21 09:57:49,Frank,Certainly not.
2017-08-24 05:14:48,Donnie,"Have you sized up the groomsmen, Jules?  As M. of H., you get first fuck.  Don't pick the short, hai"
2017-08-25 07:15:07,Frank,What?  You've been over here seven months and you ain't tapped anything?
2017-08-25 13:32:01,Frank,Can you isolate the wave?
2017-08-26 07:48:31,Donnie,Thanks.  For everything.
2017-08-27 03:17:03,Donnie,"Jade, you're late."
2017-08-27 08:05:00,Donnie,What can I do for you guys?
2017-08-27 22:44:51,Donnie,What's going on?
2017-08-28 05:13:34,Frank,Did you ever prescribe any medication for her cramps?
2017-08-28 06:07:19,Frank,"Puff, what happened to you is as much my fault as Nathan's. Maybe more so, because I knew it was wro"
2017-08-28 08:50:16,Frank,"I don't know what to tell you, Skip."
2017-08-30 04:39:02,Donnie,"And the more you tried, the more I wanted you... a vampire with your beautiful, suffering human hear"
2017-08-30 22:01:57,Frank,"How did you get him to part with it, Mr. Kane?"
2017-08-31 13:19:30,Frank,Damn it!
2017-08-31 19:24:21,Donnie,Stop it.
2017-09-02 17:46:28,Frank,They weren't my shoes.  Mine were too small.
2017-09-03 00:10:47,Frank,xxxxxx
2017-09-03 07:19:40,Donnie,Why?
2017-09-04 09:39:26,Frank,"Jesus, Bleek."
2017-09-05 07:39:35,Donnie,Is this what you wanted to speak to me about?
2017-09-06 08:18:00,Donnie,And there will come <u>another</u> moment. When the stakes are <u>really</u> there. And she will loo
2017-09-06 20:23:27,Frank,Who?
2017-09-07 16:18:38,Frank,All I can get out of her is she don't care about livin'.
2017-09-08 18:57:19,Donnie,"Well, I'm supposed monitor these seismographs.  You know, they measure vibrations..."
2017-09-08 23:23:54,Frank,Helping people makes me happy.
2017-09-08 23:27:50,Donnie,"Screw you, Wood!  I even sunk more money into different titles: ""Transvestite"" ""He Or She?"" ""I Led T"
2017-09-09 00:33:36,Donnie,I don't want to cause any trouble.
2017-09-09 20:53:03,Donnie,"I can't wait all night, Young. I'm holding a priority and if you don't answer I'm going to knock you"
2017-09-10 11:13:29,Donnie,"Listen, they only respond to vibration, right?  Couldn't we... distract them somehow?"
2017-09-11 02:29:00,Donnie,That'd be my guess.
2017-09-11 03:29:43,Frank,I didn't know we had a meeting schedule for this morning.
2017-09-11 08:21:22,Donnie,"Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried out a minute ago."
2017-09-12 09:38:23,Frank,Ted...The reason I wanted to see you...I want Billy back.
2017-09-12 12:44:58,Frank,Then say it.
2017-09-12 12:53:45,Donnie,"Loretta, don't do that."
2017-09-14 13:08:01,Frank,Permanent damage.
2017-09-16 18:01:27,Donnie,Where were you staying before the attempt on your life and why can’t you go back there?
2017-09-17 17:53:01,Frank,Who said that?
2017-09-20 17:58:17,Donnie,"Might we watch, too?"
2017-09-21 04:24:25,Donnie,"I used to bring over ten thousand at a time. That's the legal limit, so I never brought more than th"
2017-09-21 05:44:06,Donnie,You'll be getting me sad next.
2017-09-21 11:22:24,Donnie,I don't know.
2017-09-21 15:26:42,Donnie,You're just jealous.
2017-09-21 22:14:03,Frank,But it's impossible.
2017-09-22 00:53:17,Donnie,"I never thought Jack was ready for the presidency.  But I would never, never consider ...  His death"
2017-09-23 02:02:31,Frank,"Three more, I figure."
2017-09-24 01:26:37,Frank,"Sanchez, you and Palmer search the inside..."
2017-09-25 23:19:44,Frank,You live alone?
2017-09-26 00:48:25,Frank,Deeds! Who do you think I'm talking about?
2017-09-26 04:31:51,Frank,And this is Stacy.
2017-09-26 16:23:20,Frank,Ben?
2017-09-27 14:05:05,Donnie,Oh
2017-09-27 20:53:24,Frank,Resentful.
2017-09-28 06:43:58,Frank,Eh.
2017-09-28 11:51:33,Donnie,"Try not to think of that, Mrs. Brenner."
2017-09-28 23:10:56,Frank,No --
2017-09-29 10:19:38,Frank,"I've managed to every Sunday of my life. [Beat] Some of us are God- fearing men, Starks."
2017-09-30 12:22:04,Frank,Bud?
2017-10-01 19:15:15,Donnie,"She's not alive, but she didn't die."
2017-10-02 04:49:25,Frank,Who made you do this?
2017-10-02 13:48:32,Frank,"I want two eggs poached, hash brown well-done. English muffin for the bread. And a coffee."
2017-10-03 05:21:22,Frank,...what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it four ye
2017-10-03 10:37:26,Donnie,"He's probably right, sir, the building is probably going to collapse under its own weight."
2017-10-03 16:02:50,Frank,I got seven thousand.
2017-10-05 11:08:33,Donnie,"I want to fly, sir!"
2017-10-05 11:45:13,Donnie,Claire?
2017-10-06 07:45:10,Frank,Really?
2017-10-06 22:06:45,Frank,Jack.  Did you compose that yourself?
2017-10-07 06:17:50,Donnie,"Yeah, hey, oh god.  Listen, I wanted to... I don't know you very well, you know, but I wanted to ask"
2017-10-07 08:38:43,Donnie,Look who's talkin'! Jes'! He got married! Vince got married!
2017-10-07 10:20:54,Frank,"It goes from Henry VIII.  Henry VIII, Edward IV, Mary, Elizabeth I, James I, Charles I, Charles II,"
2017-10-07 14:00:07,Donnie,He hates being confronted.
2017-10-08 19:44:42,Donnie,My secret?
2017-10-09 13:21:52,Frank,We're losing the pattern...!
2017-10-11 04:20:55,Frank,"I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved."
2017-10-11 08:59:23,Frank,"You tell me.  Is he endangering his health, because if you tell me he is, I'll get him out."
2017-10-12 13:34:42,Frank,He's got doubts about hisself and that's the saddest thing of all. Would you believe that poor man t
2017-10-13 09:32:37,Frank,"I thought you'd like this.  Best thing I ever did.  If you don't want to do it, DON'T..."
2017-10-13 22:10:47,Donnie,"Negative, on surface... A manufactured object."
2017-10-14 09:02:12,Frank,"I have to talk to Frank, is he nearby?"
2017-10-16 23:23:22,Donnie,Obvious pattern -- all ties in --
2017-10-18 01:34:02,Frank,What's the matter with you?
2017-10-19 01:57:56,Frank,Good evening ... Can we pass?
2017-10-19 13:31:10,Donnie,We don't know what we're into!
2017-10-20 02:26:03,Frank,"Of course--my God, you think something this big just happens? The break-in and the cover up, of cour"
2017-10-20 10:50:22,Frank,"Perhaps I will, then."
2017-10-21 11:06:54,Donnie,What the hell ... ?!
2017-10-22 16:13:19,Frank,So talk to me tomorrow.  After the gig.
2017-10-23 20:01:20,Donnie,"Roger De Bris.  Roger De Bris.  Oh yes, the director.  Is he good... I mean bad?"
2017-10-23 20:45:02,Frank,Tell that to Bobby ... and his wife and kid.
2017-10-24 01:11:51,Frank,...the Albanian Campaign.  And we won't even be a footnote...
2017-10-24 11:44:35,Donnie,"Mapping the fucking pig genome. We'll call your dad, he's a neurosurgeon --"
2017-10-25 16:33:11,Donnie,No.
2017-10-25 23:32:53,Donnie,I know why you're so secretive. Why you won't let anybody near you.  I know what he did to you.
2017-10-26 03:10:08,Frank,God... That's in a week!
2017-10-27 03:09:53,Donnie,Was the heart attack the result of natural causes?
2017-10-27 18:48:59,Donnie,Call it an expression of trust.
2017-10-29 08:04:22,Frank,And they're sure he didn't get tangled under the outboard somehow?
2017-10-29 16:08:40,Frank,You really enjoy my company?
2017-10-29 19:51:15,Frank,I feel giddy.
2017-10-31 15:05:56,Donnie,"He didn't make it into work, and he's not home."
2017-11-01 01:30:01,Donnie,Case... it's four a.m.
2017-11-02 14:37:31,Frank,"It's an ethnic curl, I can't do anything about it."
2017-11-06 16:46:04,Donnie,So what's he doing? You believe him?
2017-11-06 23:20:00,Frank,I am too old to climb down a rope.
2017-11-07 00:03:22,Donnie,"I don't need that, Buddy.  I'm not Jack Kennedy."
2017-11-08 00:54:01,Donnie,"Hardly farmers. I've done some checking. All these were in the War. These men know sabotage, tactics"
2017-11-08 06:03:33,Donnie,"It's a strange hobby. Curious, I mean."
2017-11-08 13:12:05,Donnie,You're talking nonsense.
2017-11-09 18:48:18,Donnie,"Okay, Spats - the services are over. Lets go."
2017-11-10 23:33:25,Frank,"Can you do that? I mean, do you know anything about puppetry?"
2017-11-11 00:38:20,Frank,Where are they? Do you see them?
2017-11-11 08:02:59,Frank,"Let's blow, Chauncey."
2017-11-13 08:55:47,Donnie,Yeah?
2017-11-13 23:16:10,Frank,"Hello - Mr. Martins, we tried to get you at your hotel. We have arranged that lecture for tomorrow."
2017-11-14 00:06:39,Frank,'Thoughts'?  Not a one -- but I did hear a voice last night.
2017-11-14 05:08:34,Frank,Needs salt.
2017-11-16 00:20:04,Frank,Strength in numbers?
2017-11-16 18:24:14,Frank,"All right, all right. Now calm down, Rose, the children will hear you. Calm down, let's talk... abou"
2017-11-18 02:33:11,Donnie,"The both of youse, shaddup."
2017-11-18 05:51:17,Donnie,... the power?
2017-11-19 09:47:41,Frank,"So they tell the kid to throw the World Series, or else, huh?"
2017-11-19 11:42:05,Donnie,Sanchez...?
2017-11-19 22:02:36,Frank,I'm Sami.    Marcel sent me.
2017-11-20 02:50:55,Frank,It's nice to see you.
2017-11-20 02:56:40,Donnie,"Rough, huh?"
2017-11-20 16:03:49,Donnie,It's an anti-Christian dogma!  I cannot believe you are so calm about it!
2017-11-22 20:28:06,Frank,He's not?
2017-11-23 11:32:59,Frank,"Why doesn't Claudia talk to you, Jimmy?"
2017-11-24 10:43:02,Frank,"Excuse me, sir..."
2017-11-26 07:24:42,Donnie,Let me see this.
2017-11-27 18:38:39,Frank,Did I tell you that?
2017-11-27 22:06:40,Frank,What about hard work?
2017-11-27 22:51:34,Donnie,She pretends she's been sent by God! These charlatans -- it's a pity there isn't enough wood to burn
2017-11-28 07:36:16,Frank,"A normal human being couldn't live under the same roof with her, without going nuts.  She's my idea"
2017-11-28 21:28:53,Donnie,"You've already specified blue eyes, dark hair and fair skin.  I have taken the liberty of eradicatin"
2017-11-29 12:40:32,Donnie,"And what is the magic word, Mr. Venkman?"
2017-11-30 04:41:46,Donnie,No way. No thanks. I can't do it --
2017-12-01 16:11:37,Donnie,Me??
2017-12-02 00:53:14,Donnie,"But, PG&E told her about the chromium?"
2017-12-02 02:25:16,Frank,Maybe you inspire me.
2017-12-02 07:50:13,Frank,Surveillance Cameras?
2017-12-03 17:39:52,Frank,"Donovan, Royalton and Levinson."
2017-12-05 06:18:45,Frank,No.
2017-12-05 10:44:29,Frank,Good morning.
2017-12-05 15:49:23,Donnie,"I understand, Master"
2017-12-05 17:08:58,Donnie,I'm sorry. It seems every hour I have to...
2017-12-06 22:42:00,Donnie,"Stick her in the front, if you want to pick her up so bad. She's soaked."
2017-12-07 04:23:52,Frank,I can hardly read these.
2017-12-07 18:31:25,Frank,I have a theory that there's two kinds of boys. Those who want to be astronomers and those who want
2017-12-08 12:26:41,Frank,Well?
2017-12-09 12:23:26,Donnie,"It's a changing time. Sit down, son."
2017-12-09 18:56:31,Frank,System's running on auxiliary.  Only seven hours before it crashes.
2017-12-10 19:42:01,Donnie,Hey! Oh!
2017-12-10 20:37:39,Frank,'Cause it's fun. It don't matter if you ain't no good. It takes your mind off of everything else whi
2017-12-11 07:11:05,Donnie,"Dial someone else, okay?"
2017-12-11 07:46:07,Donnie,They have nothing to do with this --
2017-12-12 13:34:22,Donnie,"Yo! Yo! Here's my boy! Here's my boy! Who's your daddy, boy? Who is yo' daddy?"
2017-12-13 23:43:04,Donnie,"Made by YOU, Loki!"
2017-12-14 10:53:22,Frank,"Look, it's three AM.  These guys are running on bad coffee and four hours sleep.  You better start c"
2017-12-14 14:31:01,Frank,"Yeah, right.  Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room.  Adults won't see it. They can'"
2017-12-15 06:19:34,Frank,"Never get enough, huh pal?  I'd think you'd get tired of losin', Honnigan."
2017-12-15 15:09:44,Donnie,I'm a Jew in Show Business.  Why come to me?
2017-12-16 15:08:22,Donnie,Not today.
2017-12-17 16:08:17,Frank,I hate reading.
2017-12-19 22:32:29,Frank,"How about that! The bow drove half through her, but she sealed herself right up."
2017-12-19 23:56:51,Frank,I'll handle it.
2017-12-24 11:08:01,Frank,I feel like I'm entering a forbidden tomb...
2017-12-25 23:11:23,Frank,"Like Cocoa Puffs.  Good.  Captain Crunch.  Bad.  Shreds the roof of your mouth.  I mean you hear, ""T"
2017-12-26 08:24:21,Donnie,You go.
2017-12-27 07:45:43,Frank,We've traveled a long way.  We're looking for Fin Raziel.
2017-12-27 22:18:22,Frank,He doesn't gamble.
2017-12-28 09:09:02,Donnie,... Do you know who I am?
2017-12-28 17:55:49,Donnie,"Gosh, Letty, this is a great place."
2017-12-29 03:21:49,Frank,"Oh, Andy."
2017-12-29 08:22:12,Donnie,"Oh, Jesus."
2017-12-30 07:10:59,Frank,"My birth sign is Water Bearer, twenty-fifth day in the month of Janus."
2017-12-30 08:12:25,Donnie,I don't even think you have a gun!
