    "In this notebook, I'm going to demonstrate with practical examples various concepts and methods related to Pandas and Seaborn. I will rely on the data format I used for my [Facebook Conversation Analyzer project](https://github.com/5agado/conversation-analyzer). For seemingly obvious reasons I didn't use a personal conversation but automatically generated a fake and nonsensical one. Projecting or imagining some conversation relevant to you will most likely help you to better understand and memorize the content of this notebook, even greater if you can play around with your actual data.\n",

    "The main topic is data manipulation with Pandas, for example function application, groupby, aggregation and multi-indexes. All along I'll mention handy tricks that you can use for various tasks and demonstrate how we can plot results in different ways using [Seaborn](http://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html) (based on matplotlib). Given the data format, special focus is put on time-series data manipulation."

In the future I might explore other important operations here missing (take joining and merging for example), or go into more specific details on things already explored, also based on eventual feedback.\n",
