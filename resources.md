## Statistics
* [Think Stats 2e - Allen B. Downey](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-stats-2e/) (Python, good intuitive explanation of basic concepts, often from a different POV compared to other more technical books about statistics)
* [Think Bayes](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-bayes/) (Python, many good concrete examples that can be easily implemented and solved from scratch, greatly helps to absorb Bayes's Theorem and related concepts at a more intuitive level. A bit of interdependency between chapters with code written/presented in previous ones)
